Some of the research I've done in my undergrad:
- Investigation for clamp numbers on bent pipe for FIV reduction
- Non-linear vibration testing for sandwich composite structure
- Optimization of Supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle with ejector and VAR refrigeration



## Investigation for clamp numbers on bent pipe for FIV reduction

The study bases its simulation on established one-way Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) methodology. The goals were to obtain a consistent vibration signal in the form of acceleration, investigate the possible locations for placing the clamp, and investigate how much the vibration frequency fluctuates after clamping. The study uses ANSYS Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to create a bridge between the pressure and velocity obtained from fluid flow and the vibration on the pipe body. Three different mass flow rates of 180, 200, and 200 kg/s were used to simulate the variable real-life flow rate, and the vibration was considered for each case. Furthermore, 15 locations were selected to check the feasibility of clamp placement. The total accelerations and deformations were tested for each of the positions. 

## Non-linear vibration testing for sandwich composite structure

A simulink model comprised of 3DOF spring mass damper system was used to check the nature of the vibration result. An experimental setup was built to test the presence of nonlinearity in different sandwich specimen. The specimen was fabricated using butyl rubber as core sandwiched between two stainless steel plates joined with adhesive. 

## Optimization of Supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle with ejector and VAR refrigeration

The research goal was to combine power generation and cooling system by combining FCAR system, ETCR system and sCO2 Brayton cycle. The thermal performance was evaluated using Python where Multi-Objective Optimization was used to select ideal operational parameters.
