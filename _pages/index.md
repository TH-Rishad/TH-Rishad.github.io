# Biography
---
I am currently an **adjunct lecturer** of Mechanical Engineering at the [Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)](https://mist.ac.bd/), Bangladesh since June 01, 2025. I completed my Bachelor of science In Mechanical Engineering from the [Islamic University of Technology (IUT)](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/). For my undergraduate thesis, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Zahid Hossain](https://mpe.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/zahid/education) on Fluid-Structure Interaction based vibration control. I also collaborated on cascaded Brayton Cycle optimization research under [Dr. Mohammad Monjurul Ehsan](https://mpe.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/ehsan/education). As for robotics projects, I served as executive of autonomous system for autonomous flight and relief delivery of a VTOL system for [ANTS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bewithants/posts/?feedView=all). I also led the chassis design subteam of ***Project-Altair*** for the [European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu/)-2023, Poland. 

Apart from the academics and research, I enjoy playing violin and building LEGO sets.


# Research Interest
---
My research interest is primarily in Deep-Reinforcement Learning focusing on dynamic robot locomotion, i.e. Humanoid,Quadruped. I am currently learning Reinforcement Learning on OpenAI Gym with the goal of developing a wheeled biped (wheg) to achieve running jump without transitioning into a stance mode.
