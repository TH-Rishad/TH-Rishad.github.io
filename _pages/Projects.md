Some of the projects that I've worked on
- Chassis of Project Altair Mars Rover - Musafir
- Electric Box of Project Altair Mars Rover
- 4 DOF Robotic Arm for Picking and Sorting Objects
- Autonomous Navigation of Y3 and VTOL - Team ANTS



## Chassis of Project Altair Mars Rover - Musafir

This chassis is a 6kg stainless-steel frame built for the European Rover Challenge, 2023 - Onsite. The specialty of the chassis is on it's compact yet sturdy design capable of housing the robotic arm, electric box and the science module, all at once making the total weight of the rover around 55kg.

The electric box is made out of bolting together 12mm thick plywood sheets. The opening of the box is a door system housing multiple holes for conduits across the chassis. The shelf system allows space for all the electronic systems necessary for the rover as well as an additional base for placing laptop. 

## 4 DOF Robotic Arm for Picking and Sorting Objects

The system utilizes a camera for color recognition of the object. The color parameters then gets passed to the Arduino Uno microcontroller power by a laptop. The arm then performs a series of motion based on a set of fixed position arrays and places it into the correct position.

## Autonomous Navigation of Y3 and VTOL - Team ANTS

I performed the autonomous flight testing of a tilt rotor Y3 tricopter prototype. The autonomous flight included navigation across all waypoints, aid delivery and identification of ground markers. The final UAV was a fixed-wing VTOL Bijoy-16 designed by the late CTO Jahiduzzaman Tanvin for IMechE UAS Challenge 2021, for which the team won the best design award.
